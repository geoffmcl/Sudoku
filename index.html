  <h1>
   Sudoku Project C/C++
  </h1>

  <p>
   A WIN32 application to <strong>solve</strong> a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. Not perfect, and
   <strong>NOT</strong> complete...
  </p>

  <p>
   A little history. Up until circa 2012, my only involvement in Sudoku was to occasionally do the
   puzzle while sitting on the toilet ;=))
  </p>

  <p>
   01/09/2012: So decide why not try to write an eduational type program in C/C++, to solve Sudoku
   step by step. This was before I had found lots of sites, or done any other reading on
   internet... I played with the code on and off for about 1.5 months, with the last then on
   16/10/2012 with 1,011,516 Sudoku-48.zip
  </p>

  <p>
   It is a windows app, and now it can solve a large number of puzzles. Of course by that I mean
   using ONLY the same logic used by humans... Yes, it can solve every puzzle by brute force trial
   and error, but that is NOT what it is all about...
  </p>

  <p>
   So I started looking around for puzzles it can NOT solve, and then try to work out a strategy
   to get through it...
  </p>

  <p>
   20150723: Then there was a 2/3 year delay before I decided to revive the project by adding a
   CMakeLists.txt, and a `build` folder to do the out-of-source build, and push it to a <a target=
   "_blank"
      href="https://github.com/geoffmcl/Sudoku">github repo</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you have your build tools setup, then the simple build steps are :-
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>$ cd build
   </li>

   <li>$ cmake ..
   </li>

   <li>$ cmake --build . --config Release
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   Of course, alteratively the cmake GUI can be used, and then the MSVC IDE can also be used to
   build the project.
  </p>

  <p>
   The `examples` folder contains a considerable list of `sample` files which can be loaded. Or
   you can manually setup the puzzle from say a magazine and try to solve it... using the menu
   `-&gt;` Options `-&gt;` Solve!, or One Step, or simply selecting a square and entering a number
   manually...
  </p>

  <p>
   Added a cmake option, -DBUILD_WIN32_EXE:BOOL=OFF to build it as a console app, Sudo-con, which
   when used will generate a console app which accepts an input file to auto-solve. This meant I
   could also have a unix port, until I decide on which GUI code to use to build the same GUI app
   there.
  </p>

  <p>
   The main thing is <strong>have FUN!</strong>
