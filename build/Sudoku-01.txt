Hi, 

Love your site http://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm. It is the 
very BEST for learning Sudoku ;=))

A little history. Up until a few months ago, my only involvement 
in Sudoku was to occasionally do the puzzle while sitting on 
the toilet.

I am a programmer (by trade, but retired now) so a few months 
ago decide why not try to write an eduational type program 
in C/C++, to solve Sudoku step by step. This was before I had 
found your site, or done any other reading on internet...

It is a windows app, and now it can solve a large number 
of puzzles. Of course by that I mean using ONLY the same logic 
used by humans... Yes, it can solve every puzzle by brute force 
trial and error, but that is NOT what it is all about.

So I started looking around for puzzles it can NOT solve, 
and then try to work out a strategy to get through it...

I am presently STUCK on your diabolical, or an evolution of it...

Somehow you strategy eliminate the candidate 1@H9. Your 'strategy' 
says -
X-CYCLE on 1 (Discontinuous Alternating Nice Loop, length 8):
 +1[H9]-1[J9]+1[J2]-1[E2]+1[E6]-1[D4]+1[H4]-1[H9]
 - Contradiction: When H9 is set to 1 the chain implies it cannot be 1 - it can be removed

Now it is correct that the 1 has to be remvoved, but can NOT 
follow your strategy...

You suggest an X-Cycle loop
 1@I9A == 1@I2B -- 1@E2A == 1@E6B == 1@D4A == 1@H4B -- 1@H9A -- 1@I9B
 
BUT while you mark 1@E6B a weak link 1@D4B it is in fact a 
STRONG link? Likewise 1@H9A is also a weak link to 1@I9[AB]

So this is NOT a 'classic' X-Cycle where there are alternating 
STRONG/WEAK link.
