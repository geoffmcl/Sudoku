# Checking Unique Rectangle Scan
#  from : http://zitowolf.net/sudoku/strategy.html#xcycles
# examples\uniqrect1.txt   # OK - solved but NOT using UR!
# 20120808 - Added elimination here BUT still NOT SOLVED
# examples\uniqrect2.txt   # FAILS!!!
# 20120808 - Added Do_UniqRect_Scan() and Do_Fill_UniqRect() - sg_Fill_Uniq - SOLVED
# examples\uniqrect4.txt	# ok - solved but not using NR
# Type 1 - correctly elim 5@D4 and 7@D4
# examples\uniqrect5.txt		# ok solved but not using UR - but mark UR elims 2 if used
# Type 2 - elim 6@B2 & 6@A8, but has other solution trails - so only good for SHOWING
# examples\uniqrect7.txt	# ok
# Type 3 - marks rect, but elim???
# examples\uniqrect8.txt		# MAYBE, but solved using other strategies
# Type 4 - marks rect, but elim??? 
# examples\uniqrect9.txt	# ok - solved but NOT using unique rectangles???

# from : http://www.sudoku.org.uk/SolvingTechniques/UniqueRectangles.asp
# Type 4 - marks rect, and elims 6@A3 & 6@C5 BUT site elims 1@C1 & 1@C3
# examples\uniqrect10.txt	# ok - solved other ways

# Naked Triple
# examples\naked-triple.txt
# But this is already solved, but notheless added a Do_Naked_Triple_Scan(), which seems ok
# done after Do_Naked_Pair_Scan() fails...
# These triples were in Boxes...
# examples\naked-triple2.txt
# a more general case where the triple are in a single COL
# examples\naked-triple3.txt

#// 20120809 - Seems a PROBLEM with Y-Wing scan
#// IN the above case it eliminates 5@I9, leaving 
#// a SINGLE 8, which is the WRONG solution - FIX20120911 - New Y-Wing RULE

# progressed quite well, but near the end coloring missed an elimination... run_test3, cand 7
